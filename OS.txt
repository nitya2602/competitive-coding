-Windows is multitasking OS. Multiuser OS is an OS that allows multiple users on different computers or terminals to access a single system with one OS on it.

-Deadlock - Two or more processes are waiting indefinitely for an event that can be caused by only one of the waiting processes. A set of blocked processes each holding a resource and waiting to acquire a resource held by another process

-Starvation - Indefinite blocking. A process may never be removed from the semaphore queue in which it is suspended.

-Dining philosopher's problem - using semaphores and monitor
-Producer consumer problem - Semaphores and mailbox
-Readers writers problem - semaphores

-Semaphore - OS support for synchronization, a tool that does not require busy waiting. wait and signal are atomic processes

-Synchronization: Mutual exclusion, progress and bounded waiting

-Conditions for deadlock: Mutual exclusion, hold and wait, no preemption, circular wait

-FCFS - Convoy effect(penalizes short processes)

-SJF - Shortest process next(non preemptive, long processes might starve), Shortest remaining time first(srtf), SJF gives min average waiting time for a set of processes (it is optimal)

-Round Robin - Higher average turnaround time than SJF but better response, unfair to i/o bound processes. Virtual round robin with an auxiliary queue

-Highest response ratio next(HRNN) - non preemptive, uses normalised turnaround time

-Fair share scheduling

Memory Management

-Fixed partitioning
 -Equal sized - a lot of space may be wasted if program is small and if it is too large, we need to write overlays
  -Unequal size - Program is loaded into best fit partition, queue for each partition

-Dynamic partitioning - External fragmentation, first fit, next fit and best fit perform better than worst fit in terms of speed and storage utilization, we need to do compaction

-Buddy system - A compromise to overcome shortcoming of fixed and variable partitioning scheme

-Paging(Dynamic partitioning) - logical address space is divided into pages and physical into frames, sizeof(page) = sizeof(frame) for a system

-Translation look-aside buffers or associative registers -> These are fast lookup hardware cache

-Segmentation - Memory management scheme that supports user view of memory

-Page replacement algorithms:
 -FIFO(First in first out) - page faults decrease with increase in number of frames but here we have Belady's anomaly
 -Optimal algorithm - It is used to measure how well an algorithm performs
 -Least recently used (LRU) - keep a stack of page numbers in a double link form and when a page is referenced, move it to the top

-Thrashing - A process is busy swapping pages in and out. More pronounced for global page replacement policies

-Seek time is the time for the disk arm to move the
heads to the cylinder containing the desired sector.

-Rotational latency is the additional time waiting for the
disk to rotate the desired sector to the disk head.

-Disk scheduling alogorithms: FCFS, SSTF(a form of SJF scheduling, Shortest seek time first, can cause starvation), SCAN(elevator algorithm), C-SCAN(gives more uniform wait time than SCAN), C-LOOK
